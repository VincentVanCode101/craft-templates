# {PROJECT_NAME}
### **How to Start the Project Using Docker**

This project is configured to run inside a Docker container for consistent development environments. Follow the steps below to set up, start, and use the project.

---

### **Steps to Start the Project**

#### **1. Build and Start the Docker Environment**
Use the provided `docker-compose.dev.yml` file to build and start the development container.

- **Build the container:**
  ```bash
  docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml build
  ```

- **Start the container:**
  ```bash
  docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
  ```

- **Confirm the container is running:**
  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```
  Look for a container named `{PROJECT_NAME}-java-env`.

#### **2. Connect to the Development Container**
Once the container is running, connect to it for development purposes.

- **Open a bash session in the container:**
  ```bash
  docker exec -it {PROJECT_NAME}-java-env bash
  ```
  - use the `make` command from here on (see the chapter below)

> [!NOTE]
> When you have started the docker compose, quarkus is already running in the dev mode

### **How to Use the Makefile (Container Usage)**

This `Makefile` is designed to streamline the process of building, running, testing, and cleaning up a Java project inside a Docker container environment. The commands are optimized to work with a typical Java/Maven project structure and can be executed within the container.

You need to connect to the [development container](#2-connect-to-the-development-container) and can use the `make` commands here (and only here... not outside the container)

- **Build the application**:
  ```bash
  make build
  ```
- **Run the application in development mode**:
  ```bash
  make dev
  ```
- **Run tests**:
  ```bash
  make test
  ```
- **Package the application into an uber-jar**:
  ```bash
  make package
  ```

> [!NOTE]
> The `Makefile` does not include a target for building native executables since GraalVM or Docker-based native builds are not available inside the development container. To build a native executable, use a compatible external setup. (The feature to get this up and running will come soon.)

## Notes
- **Remove Maven Wrappers**: Since the project uses Docker for build and runtime environments, the `mvnw` and `mvnw.cmd` files can be removed to avoid the installation of Maven locally.
